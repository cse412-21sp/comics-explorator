## Project Proposal Abstract

In our project we want to dive into the world of comic books and their heroes. In particular, we want to compare trends between DC and Marvel comics, Manga, their sales, popularity, character archetypes, etc. Lots of people around the world are reading comic books or watching adaptations of them and inevitably at some point they all find themselves looking for something new. We want to create interactive visualizations so that the audience could explore their interests in different kinds of comics and find something new or similar they would like to read/watch. We will sort comic characters by abilities, appearances, alignment, popularity of sales into visualizations of DIY models so users can scout out new interesting characters that they want to read about.
